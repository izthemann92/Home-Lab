## ⚙️ 1.1 Laptop Hardware Lab

### 🎯 Objective
Identify, replace, and configure laptop components including storage, memory, battery, and display.

### 🧰 Tools Required
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| 🪛 Small screwdriver kit | Open chassis or simulate teardown |
| 💻 VirtualBox | VM disk replacement simulation |
| 🧩 Clonezilla / `dd` | Drive cloning |
| 🪫 Old laptop (optional) | Physical reference |

---

### 💻 Lab Steps

#### Step 1 — Identify Components
- Power down your laptop (or reference teardown images).  
- Label: RAM, storage, battery, keyboard ribbon, Wi‑Fi card.

#### Step 2 — Simulate Drive Replacement
<details>
<summary>🖥️ Linux Commands</summary>

```bash
# List disks
lsblk
sudo fdisk -l

# (VirtualBox) Add new virtual disk via VM settings, then format it:
sudo parted /dev/sdb --script mklabel gpt mkpart primary ext4 1MiB 100%

# Clone old drive to new (adjust devices as needed)
sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=64K status=progress conv=noerror,sync

# Verify partitions and mount test
sudo partprobe
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/newdisk
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/newdisk
df -hT | grep -E 'Filesystem|sdb'
```
</details>

#### Step 3 — Boot and Verify
- Temporarily set the new disk as first boot target (VM storage order).  
- Confirm OS boots successfully and files are present.

---

### ✅ Completion Checklist
- [ ] Identified hardware components  
- [ ] Cloned system drive successfully  
- [ ] Verified boot and data integrity  

📸 **Screenshot Evidence:** `lsblk` output and successful desktop/console after boot.

## 🔗 1.2 Connecting Mobile Devices

### 🎯 Objective
Establish wired and wireless connectivity between laptops, tablets, and smartphones; validate file transfer.

### 🧰 Tools Required
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| 📱 Smartphone | USB (MTP) + hotspot + Bluetooth |
| 🧵 USB‑C/Lightning cable | Wired connection |
| 🌐 Bluetooth on host | Wireless pairing |
| 🖥️ Windows 11 & Ubuntu VMs | Cross‑platform tests |

---

### 💻 Lab Steps

#### Step 1 — USB (MTP) Connection
- Connect phone to Windows 11 VM (ensure VM has USB passthrough).  
- On phone, select **File Transfer (MTP)**. Verify device in **This PC**.

#### Step 2 — Bluetooth Pairing
<details>
<summary>🪟 Windows</summary>

```powershell
# List Bluetooth radios and devices
Get-PnpDevice -Class Bluetooth | Sort-Object -Property FriendlyName

# Quick send via UI: Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Add device
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🐧 Ubuntu</summary>

```bash
bluetoothctl
scan on
# wait for MAC address
pair <MAC>
connect <MAC>
trust <MAC>
exit
```
</details>

#### Step 3 — Transfer Test
- Send a small file (PNG/TXT) over Bluetooth in **both directions**.  
- Disconnect/reconnect to confirm automatic pairing trust.

---

### ✅ Completion Checklist
- [ ] Phone recognized via USB (MTP)  
- [ ] Bluetooth paired on both OSes  
- [ ] File transfer verified bi‑directionally  

📸 **Screenshot Evidence:** Windows Explorer showing phone storage; Ubuntu `bluetoothctl` success messages.

## 🌐 1.3 Mobile Device Networks & MDM

### 🎯 Objective
Use a mobile hotspot for WAN access; capture addressing; apply basic device policy settings.

### 🧰 Tools Required
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| 📶 Smartphone with hotspot | Provide Wi‑Fi WAN |
| 💻 Windows 11 VM | Validate DHCP + browsing |
| 🐧 Ubuntu Server | CLI validation + routing test |
| 🔐 Device policy settings | Screen lock, auth, app limits |

---

### 💻 Lab Steps

#### Step 1 — Enable Hotspot
- Phone: **Settings → Hotspot & Tethering → Wi‑Fi Hotspot → ON** (SSID: `LabNet-Hotspot`).

#### Step 2 — Connect Windows 11 VM
<details>
<summary>🪟 Windows</summary>

```powershell
ipconfig /all
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 8.8.8.8 -InformationLevel Detailed
tracert 1.1.1.1
```
</details>

#### Step 3 — Connect Ubuntu
<details>
<summary>🐧 Ubuntu</summary>

```bash
nmcli device status
nmcli device wifi list | sed -n '1,10p'
nmcli device wifi connect "LabNet-Hotspot" password "<YourPass>" ifname wlan0
ip a
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
traceroute cloudflare.com
```
</details>

#### Step 4 — Simulate MDM Policy
- Enable **screen lock with PIN/biometric**, restrict app installs, and enable cloud backup.  
- Note policy names and locations used.

---

### ✅ Completion Checklist
- [ ] Hotspot connection on both VMs  
- [ ] IP/gateway/DNS captured  
- [ ] Successful Internet tests  
- [ ] Security policy set on device  

📸 **Screenshot Evidence:** `ipconfig /all`, `ip a` + successful pings; phone policy screen.
