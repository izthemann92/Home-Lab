# ðŸ§ª SOHO firewall and port fowarding 

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
simulate a small office/home office (SOHO) environement by configuring firewall rules and port fowarding between your windwows 11 and ubuntu server.

learn how network traffic moves through your router/firewall and how to control access to internal services.

Configure Ubuntuâ€™s firewall (UFW) to restrict and allow specific network traffic

Set up port forwarding so you can reach your Ubuntu server through a designated port

ðŸ§° Requirements

Ubuntu Server 22.04 (static IP: 192.168.10.20)

Windows 11 Pro (static IP: 192.168.10.11)

VirtualBox with NAT or Bridged networking (to simulate router or external access)

## ðŸ§© Steps Performed
1. Verify baseline connectivity ( Ubuntu + Windows) 
2. installed OpenSSH Server on windows 
script : Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0

3. install and enable ssh on ubuntu
script: One line at a time.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl status ssh

4. lab 02 congifugre UFW on  allowing specific traffic through the firewall

sudo apt install ufw -y
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw status numbered

5. install and enable openssh server on windows
powershell:
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
Start-Service sshd
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'
New-NetFirewallRule -Name sshd -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (Port 22)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22

6. connectivity Test (ubuntu -> windows)
ssh labadmin@192.168.10.11

7. connectivity Test (Windows -> Ubuntu)
ssh izthemann@192.168.10.20

## ðŸ§  Troubleshooting / Notes
- Had to create seperate user known as Labadmin to properly make the connection because my microsoft orginazation was effecting the process

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots
*(Add your images in the /screenshots folder)*

## ðŸ§¾ Summary
Network was verified both directions
firwalls were configured correctly
SSH communication working between windows and ubuntu
port fowarding was succesfully simulated
